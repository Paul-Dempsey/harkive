# harkive

A Windows command-line Haken EaganMatrix preset archiver.

Loads and saves presets from any device with Haken Audio's EaganMatrix engine.
Due to historic Windows limitations, it cannot be used while the Haken Editor is running.

Special thanks to Lippold Haken for creating an amazing instrument.
This project wouldn't be possible without extra information graciously provided by Dr. Haken.
